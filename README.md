# SomeFunGames
I built a game with python, maybe i add some more later.


# How to Run 
1- you should install python.

2- this game will need pygame. you can install it with this command:
```
pip install pygame
```
 
3- after that it will be easy. just run this command:
```
python ./main.py
```

##### PS: I will try to add some more games later.
